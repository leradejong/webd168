        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I live in San Diego. I moved here from SF a few years ago and love it
          very much. I have been working in QA for 10 years, and I really enjoy
          it.
        </p>

        <h2>Why am I taking this class?</h2>
        <p>
          I am taking this class as part of my Web Development degree, but I
          also find HTML and CSS very interesting and great exercise for the
          brain. I work in QA, and improving my coding skills will help me in my
          day-to-day work and advance my career.

        <h2>Things I want to get from this class</h2>
        <p>
          I want to gain more confidence in my web development knowledge. And
          the best way to get it is by doing it. I learned so much in webd152,
          and I am very excited to keep learning.
        </p>
