      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        I live in San Diego. I moved here from SF a few years ago and love it
        very much. I have been working in QA for 10 years, and I really enjoy
        it.
      </p>

      <h2>Why am I taking this class?</h2>
      <p>
        I am taking this class as part of my Web Development degree, but I also
        find HTML and CSS very interesting and great exercise for the brain. I
        work in QA, and improving my coding skills will help me in my day-to-day
        work and advance my career.
      </p>

      <h2>Things I want to get from this class</h2>
      <p>
        I want to gain more confidence in my web development knowledge. And the
        best way to get it is by doing it. I learned so much in webd152, and I
        am very excited to keep learning.
      </p>

      <h2>My Interests</h2>
      <p>Here are some hobbies I am currently enjoying:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sewing: I am learning to make clothes.</li>
        <li>French: Aiming to speak fluently someday.</li>
        <li>
          Improv theater: There is something magical about making up things in
          front of a live audience.
        </li>
      </ul>
